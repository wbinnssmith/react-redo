# React Redo

Everybody's favorite demonstration app of the frontend! Build with react and redux for the user interface, and express and node for a simple api. Uses bookshelf for a lightweight ORM to interface with the database.

Todos are sent over HTTP from the browser and persisted in a local database (sqlite3 in development).
